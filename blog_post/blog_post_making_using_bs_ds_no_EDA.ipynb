    "    - **Suggestion: This is totally worth it.**  It adds a little complexity to the cookie-cutting set up process, but  it:\n",
    "        - makes updating your package a breeze.\n",
    "        - makes it easier for others to contribute to your package \n",
    "        -  it will pre-test any Pull Requests so you will already know if the code is functional before you merge their code with yours.<br><br>\n",
    "3. [ ] **Register an account on [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) [OPTIONAL, BUT REC'D IF SHARING YOUR WORK]**\n",

    "    -  As long as you do not bumpversion, Travis will _test_ your updated package, but it will _fail to deploy it_. since PyPi already has a pre-existing distribution for that version #.\n",
    "    - Documentation Note:\n",
    "        - Readthedocs.org will test and update your documentation for ANY commit. So if you only need to update an aspect of the doc's, you can simply change the settings and push your repo _without_ having to bumpversion."
